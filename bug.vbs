Function doesn't return expected value due to implicit type coercion.  VBScript's loose typing can lead to unexpected results when comparing or manipulating data. For instance, comparing a string "1" to a number 1 might evaluate to false, whereas you'd expect true.  Another issue is the lack of explicit error handling; a script might fail silently without indicating the cause, especially in functions that don't use "On Error Resume Next" or "On Error GoTo" correctly.
